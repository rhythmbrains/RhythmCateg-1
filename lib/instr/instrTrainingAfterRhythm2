Awesome job!


Did you notice it was the same rhythmic pattern as before? 

The only thing that differed was the bass sound!
The speed of the bass sound was different. 
But it still worked, it was synchronized with the rhythm. 
And it did feel like a good pulse. 

Important lesson to remember: 
When listening to the same rhythm, there are often different 
plausible pulses we can feel and tap to. 

Depending on the pulse we feel, the rhythm itself can actually sound 
very different! 


Next, lets try something new. 
Whenever you’re ready to continue.
